# Sepsis predictor web dashboard

After we have a finalized model, We want to build a web dashboard application that implemented the finalized model to an actual concrete application and deploy to production server. We want to develop this project like a real world development process from model training to an app implementation.

At first, I was using Python Flask as a web development tool to develop this project but later I’ve found DASH by plotly which is quite similar to Flask because It’s 100% python. So the advantage of DASH by plotly is, It actually a web framework that built on top of python flask, Basically DASH by plotly environment is quite similar to Flask but It particularly designed for the web dashboard development. It has built in html and chart components ready to use, That helped me a lot to develop this project in a short period of time.
